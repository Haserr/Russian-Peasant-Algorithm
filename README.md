    This is a program I made a few years ago demonstrating the Russian Peasant Multiplication algorithm.
    It is written in C and takes 2 integer arguements as inputs. Compile using gcc. 
    
    
    An example of the output would look something like this: 
     3      4      4
     1      8      8
              ------
                   12
    
    The arguements given in the above example were 3 and 4 using the command "./a.out 3 4"
